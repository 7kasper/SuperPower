| 28 | Hysterisis between battery low and battery ready.     | Solar devices in winter may bump along at minimum voltage for extended periods.  For some applications, it may be better for the micro to go to sleep for an extended period to allow the battery to charge more than the minimum amount.                                                                                                                        | metimmee       | feature      |  |

| 34 | Expose ESP32 Serial pinouts for flashing              | If we plan to have a module soldered on the PCB, we would need to flash it, a serial to usb converter might not be necessary to be on the pcb as it could be similar to the ESP32-cam with external serial to usb.
