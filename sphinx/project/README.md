SuperPower
==========

Here you should find the best power supplies for your low-power projects. Because of different requirements for an Raspberry Pi and micro-controllers like the ESP32 we split the project into two boards, one for the Raspberry Pi (SuperPower-Rpi) and one for micro-controllers (SuperPower-uC) with low power.

All hardware designs and products you can find in this repository is licensed under CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal
